        Accused witches were tried in criminal courts. In the courtroom on the
        day of the trial, there was a judge who presided over the proceedings
        and made rulings on the law, a jury (fifteen property owning members of
        the local community) who decided on a verdict of innocent or guilty, and
        a clerk to keep records. There would also be a prosecutor to present the
        accusations. The accused person would be able to speak in their own
        defence. If the trial was held in the central Edinburgh court of
        justiciary, the court would also assign a defence lawyer to the person.
        If the jury convicted the accused person, the judge would pass sentence.
        In a witchcraft case the sentence was usually death by strangulation
        followed by burning. Convictions were common but not universal; some
        people were acquitted.

      Evidence against the accused person had to be gathered beforehand. This
      was often done by local church courts - kirk sessions or presbyteries.
      These bodies were not criminal courts, but they could summon people and
      interrogate them. Two main kinds of evidence were used against witchcraft
      suspects: neighbours' testimony, and the suspect's own confession. If the
      suspect was thought to have bewitched her or his neighbours, these
      neighbours could make statements about this, telling stories about
      quarrels and bewitchments that had followed. Or, if the suspect was
      thought to have made a pact with the Devil, the suspect herself or himself
      could be interrogated about this. Interrogations were often done
      coercively; usually little was written down about this, but the most
      common form of torture seems to have been sleep deprivation. This was used
      due to its effectiveness and was usually conducted by local authorities.
      Confession evidence tended to have much more about the suspect's dealings
      with the Devil. Confessions could also implicate other suspects, if a
      suspect was asked something like 'Who else was present when you met the
      Devil?'.

      <p class="mb-3 text-justify">
        A third kind of evidence was sometimes used: 'pricking' to discover the
        Devil's mark. The accused witch was stripped partially or completely
        naked, and their body was pricked with a pin to find an insensitive spot
        where the pin could be inserted. The idea was that the Devil placed an
        invisible mark on the witch's body at the time when they agreed to
        become a witch, in an echo or parody of Christian baptism; the pin would
        find this mark.

    <p class="mb-3 text-justify">
      It is important to distinguish witch-pricking from 'torture'. Torture
      inflicted pain in order to make the suspect confess; the aim was to obtain
      a confession as evidence. This was not a punishment, but an attempt to
      secure evidence. Witch-pricking aimed to inflict no pain; the aim was to
      identify the Devil's mark as evidence. However, in practice the process
      probably did cause at least some pain. It was also coercive and
      humiliating for a person, especially a woman, to be stripped naked in the
      presence of a group of men. One side-effect of pricking could be to break
      down a suspect's resistance to interrogation; some suspects began to
      confess after they were told that a mark had been found

          Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh. It marks the location of the entrance
          to Edinburgh's Old Tolbooth which was demolished in 1817. Locals will
          often spit upon the heart as a sign of good luck. However, it was
          originally believed to be done as a sign of disdain for the executions
          which took place within the Old Tolbooth. (Kim Trayner, CC BY-SA 3.0)

        Witch-prickers were all men; sometimes an ordinary interrogator (such as
        a parish elder or minister) would do the pricking, but during the major
        panics a handful of professional 'prickers' claimed special expertise in
        the technique, and travelled round pricking numerous suspects in return
        for modest fees. Most prickers seem to have believed in the genuineness
        of their own powers, though there was a notorious fraudulent episode in
        Peebles in 1649-50 in which the pricker George Cathie colluded with the
        accused witch Janet Coutts to get her to name other suspects whom he
        would then prick. Several dozen executions occurred before the fraud was
        detected. Another pricker, 'Mr Paterson', turned out to be a woman in
        disguise, named Christian Cadell

      It should be noted that Scottish courts hardly ever used the 'swimming
      test' or 'water ordeal' in which suspects were dropped in water; this was
      recorded in Scotland only in 1597. The swimming test was used from time to
      time in some other European countries, though it was never normal. (Today
      there is a belief that innocent suspects sank and were drowned; this is a
      myth. Nobody drowned; suspects had a rope tied to them and were pulled
      out.)
    </p>
    <p class="mb-3 text-justify">
      The use of these techniques in interrogations declined in Scotland towards
      the end of the 17th century. This is due to a growth in judicial
      scepticism, particularly surrounding the use of torture. Thus, the use of
      torture in interrogations of accused witches declined from the 1660s; yet
      we know that it still used in a couple of cases until 1708.

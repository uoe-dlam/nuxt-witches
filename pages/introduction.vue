            During the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries Scotland went through a series of changes to the state and church which fuelled the Scottish witch hunt. As a result of the Reformation, when Scotland broke away from the Catholic Church and moved towards Protestantism, the church went through an upheaval of religious belief and became much more interested in what ordinary people did and believed. The Church was particularly worried about the people of Scotland committing sins, for instance breaking sabbath (having fun or working on a Sunday), quarrelling with each other, whether they practised the ‘right’ religion in the right way or not, having sex outside of marriage, and witchcraft. At the same time, the state became stronger, which meant that it became more able to interfere with ordinary people’s lives; it was worried that if sins were to go unpunished, then God would punish Scotland himself with plagues, famines, natural disasters and wars. Church and state were both occupied with becoming more ‘godly’ and ultimately worked together to fight against sin and expose and prosecute suspected witches. Witchcraft became a secular capital crime, as well as a sin, in 1563 by an act of the Scottish parliament.

            This led to the persecution of upwards of 4000 people in Scotland between 1563 and 1736, in what we now recognize as the Scottish witch-hunts. Of these people accused as witches it is estimated that around 2,500, around two-thirds, were executed. The majority of those executed were women, approximately 85%, but men were certainly not safe from suspicion, accusation, and condemnation. This gender division is similar to that in other mainland European countries. As can be seen on the map, the majority of accused witches in Scotland resided in the central belt with 32% of named accused witches coming from the Lothians. East Lothian, historically known as Haddingtonshire, is the county in which witch-hunting was most fierce. There were various ‘panic periods’, periods of high levels of accusation and prosecution, particularly in 1590-1, 1597, 1628-30, 1649, and 1661-2; these can also be explored through the map. As the seventeenth century ended, central courts became increasingly less convinced by the usual kinds of evidence that were used to prove guilt. In particular, the credibility of the use of torture in obtaining confessions was questioned. As the state became more secular going into the eighteenth century, it no longer needed to prove its godliness. The last prosecution of an accused witch in Scotland occurred in 1727 and the Scottish Witchcraft Act was repealed in 1736.

            It is important to remember that, whilst this map allows you to explore the accused witches for who names can be found, there are many more not included on this map for whom the evidence is too sparse, or unfortunately just does not exist. If you are interested in learning more about the witch-hunts in Scotland, there are many fantastic books and articles.

    <p class="mt-6 mb-3 text-lg md:text-xl lg:text-xl font-medium">Teaching data science with ‘real-world’ datasets</p>
    <p class="mb-3">Since 2017 teams at the University of Edinburgh have been supporting students to learn about data science and develop their skills through working with a ‘real-world’ datasets.  The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft database is one of those datasets.</p>
    <p class="mb-3"><a class="underline hover:text-gray-500" href="http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/witches" target="_blank">The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft Database</a></p>
    <p class="mb-3">We appreciate all feedback and will incorporate it into future iterations of the map and the projects delivered by students.</p>
    <p class="mb-3">Professor Julian Goodare is a historian and project director for the original Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, so his input and suggestions continue to be extremely valuable to us. The technical work on this project has been led by colleagues in our Digital Learning and Media Teams and in Wikimedia UK . Most notably Karen Howie, Ewan McAndrew, Anne-Marie Scott, Richard Lawson, Stewart Cromar, Andrew Middleton, Navino Evans, Martin Poulter and Simon Cobb. We are indebted to them for the work they have done and the time they spend supporting students who work on data skills curriculum projects and internships.</p>
    <p class="mt-6 mb-3 text-md md:text-gl lg:text-lg font-medium">Richard Lawson</p>
    <p class="mb-3">Richard was the person most responsible for creating this website and for always giving his time generously to this project; to support student learning within the University and to support understanding about the Scottish witch trials globally. He taught himself within two weeks how to work with an unfamiliar platform and achieved the remarkable in always using his considerable technical expertise to solve any issue we had in creating the site and helping put these persecuted women on the map. Richard supported all subsequent ‘Witchfinder General’: Data Visualisation student interns and always with kindness, humility and a gentle humour. He died suddenly on 10 October 2023 and this site is a tribute to his brilliance and commitment to the project and we dedicate it to his memory.</p>

        <p class="mb-3">During the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 course programme, the University of Edinburgh’s Wikimedian in Residence, Ewan McAndrew, supported students to surface selected data from the original MS Access database to Wikipedia’s sister project, Wikidata, as structured, machine-readable, linked open data.</p>
        <p> Students on the Data Science for Design MSc created engaging visualisations from these real world datasets. One group chose create an interactive physical map of accused witches in Scotland laser cut and engraved from an A1 block of wood and creating bespoke pieces to visualise the gender distribution of accused witches in each region of Scotland and the different torture techniques employed in each region.</p>

Geographical information such as trial location, place of detainment and place of death locations were also added onto the accused witches’ Wikidata pages using the open source software, OpenRefine. There were also other properties added for the accused witches from their charge to inhumane treatment type to build a strong Wikidata page for each accused witch which is displayed for each accused witch on the website maps.</p>

        <p class="mb-3">4th year Computer Science student, Maggie Lin, was employed as our second ‘Witchfinder General’: Data Visualisation intern and worked incredibly hard to help illuminate what happened in the Scottish witchhunts of 1563 to 1736 by focusing on opening up the rich historical data in the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft database and turning it into linked open data, creating user-friendly web visualisations with her developer colleague Josep Garcia-Reyero (also an undergrad student). </p>
        <p class="mb-3">Maggie’s focus was on the hitherto unexplored temporal data and the all the rich information on the witchcraft investigations, which encompassed the initial or supposed denunciation, the arrest, the investigation, the trial, and its aftermath.  She focused especially on all the different accusations: who named/denounced who, what occurred in the supposed witches’ meetings, the ritual objects used, accusations of shapechanging and much more. By working round the clock to turn this data into something parseable she created timelines, network analyses of who named who, helped show how the hysteria spread in space and time during panic and non panic periods and even investigated accusations of demonology and attended a symposium on such. She presented on her work at the Edinburgh Book Festival 2022 before the Jenni Fagan book event, <i>Hex</i>, and has contributed blog articles documenting her work and recorded a podcast interview.</p>

      Teaching data science with ‘real-world’ datasets
    </p>
    <p>
      Since 2017 teams at the University of Edinburgh have been supporting
      students to learn about data science and develop their skills through
      working with a ‘real-world’ datasets. The Survey of Scottish Witchcraft
      database is one of those datasets.

      We appreciate all feedback and will incorporate it into future iterations
      of the map and the projects delivered by students.

      Professor Julian Goodare is a historian and project director for the
      original Survey of Scottish Witchcraft, so his input and suggestions
      continue to be extremely valuable to us. The technical work on this
      project has been led by colleagues in our Digital Learning and Media Teams
      and in Wikimedia UK . Most notably Karen Howie, Ewan McAndrew, Anne-Marie
      Scott, Richard Lawson, Stewart Cromar, Andrew Middleton, Navino Evans,
      Martin Poulter and Simon Cobb. We are indebted to them for the work they
      have done and the time they spend supporting students who work on data
      skills curriculum projects and internships.

      Richard was the person most responsible for creating this website and for
      always giving his time generously to this project; to support student
      learning within the University and to support understanding about the
      Scottish witch trials globally. He taught himself within two weeks how to
      work with an unfamiliar platform and achieved the remarkable in always
      using his considerable technical expertise to solve any issue we had in
      creating the site and helping put these persecuted women on the map.
      Richard supported all subsequent ‘Witchfinder General’: Data Visualisation
      student interns and always with kindness, humility and a gentle humour. He
      died suddenly on 10 October 2023 and this site is a tribute to his
      brilliance and commitment to the project and we dedicate it to his memory.

          During the 2017/2018 and 2018/2019 course programme, the University of
          Edinburgh’s Wikimedian in Residence, Ewan McAndrew, supported students
          to surface selected data from the original MS Access database to
          Wikipedia’s sister project, Wikidata, as structured, machine-readable,
          linked open data.
        </p>
        <p>
          Students on the Data Science for Design MSc created engaging
          visualisations from these real world datasets. One group chose create
          an interactive physical map of accused witches in Scotland laser cut
          and engraved from an A1 block of wood and creating bespoke pieces to
          visualise the gender distribution of accused witches in each region of
          Scotland and the different torture techniques employed in each region.

          an interactive map as linked open data through Wikipedia's sister

          detainment and place of death locations were also added onto the

          accused witch on the website maps.

      conducted user testing, and imported more data to create an upcoming

          4th year Computer Science student, Maggie Lin, was employed as our
          second ‘Witchfinder General’: Data Visualisation intern and worked
          incredibly hard to help illuminate what happened in the Scottish
          witchhunts of 1563 to 1736 by focusing on opening up the rich
          historical data in the Survey of Scottish Witchcraft database and
          turning it into linked open data, creating user-friendly web
          visualisations with her developer colleague Josep Garcia-Reyero (also
          an undergrad student).
        </p>
        <p>
          Maggie’s focus was on the hitherto unexplored temporal data and the
          all the rich information on the witchcraft investigations, which
          encompassed the initial or supposed denunciation, the arrest, the
          investigation, the trial, and its aftermath. She focused especially on
          all the different accusations: who named/denounced who, what occurred
          in the supposed witches’ meetings, the ritual objects used,
          accusations of shapechanging and much more. By working round the clock
          to turn this data into something parseable she created timelines,
          network analyses of who named who, helped show how the hysteria spread
          in space and time during panic and non panic periods and even
          investigated accusations of demonology and attended a symposium on
          such. She presented on her work at the Edinburgh Book Festival 2022
          before the Jenni Fagan book event, <i>Hex</i>, and has contributed
          blog articles documenting her work and recorded a podcast interview.

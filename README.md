# Witches

Witches is a website from the University of Edinburgh that uses data from the 
[Survey of Scottish Witchcraft](http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/Research/witches) to provide various maps about witches, their 
trials, and associated persons.

## Running the site locally
This site is built using the [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) framework. If you would like to run this site locally, simply
download the repository and run the following commands in the project's root directory. Please note, you must have node 
and node package manager installed locally to issue these commands:

```
npm i
npm run generate
npm run start
```

The commands will:

- Install all required node packages
- Generate the static web files used to serve the site
- Run a local web server, so you can visit the site served from your local machine

Note that all packages are now up to date with their latest versions, appart from @nuxtjs/tailwindcss, the latest verion of which is not yet supported. We have instead used the newest working version.
